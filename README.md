# Project Overview

The purpose of this project was to combine previous modules with new information. This module required the use of Pandas, Flask, MongoDB, HTML and Python. These tools were used together to scrape website with information related to Mars. The scraped data was then loaded into MongoDB and rendered onto a locally hosted webpage using app.py code.
